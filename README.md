# Learning-Projects

Welcome to my learning journey where I document my progress and projects in programming and data science, particularly with a focus on geographical data. This repository serves as a log of my continuous growth and self-challenge to deepen my skills through hands-on projects.

My journey into programming began with a simple idea: I wanted to create an app that could help students learn English by selecting random words from a vocabulary list, providing them with the corresponding unit and page to study at home. This initial project sparked my interest in Python programming.

As I delved deeper into programming, my curiosity expanded, leading me to learn more about data science, especially in the context of geography. In 2023, I began my master's degree in Geographic Data Science, which further solidified my passion for analyzing and understanding spatial data.

After completing my course, I participated in several learning projects that inspired me to create personal challenges to enhance my data-related skills. This repository is the result of that initiative, where I aim to:
- Tackle new projects, covering topics like data science, machine learning, and geographical analysis.
- Continuously refine my programming abilities in Python, SQL, and other tools.
- Document my learning process, code, and the output of each project.
